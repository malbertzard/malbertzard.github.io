## Introduction

Hey there! I’m Mathis, a Dev from Germany. I specialize in backend development with PHP and Python. Right now, I’m diving into Golang.
Professional Background

I’ve got a ton of experience with PHP, especially in Laravel and Symfony, doing the full stack thing in both. Lately, I've been messing around with Golang, making CLI tools to make dev life suck less. In my free time, and when I should have been paying attention in class, I’ve played with a bunch of other programming languages, with a soft spot for Python.

So, yeah, that’s me. Poke around if you’re curious.
